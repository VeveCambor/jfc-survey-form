# SURVEY FORM

This repo is created as part of a challenge in the community of (mostly beginning) developers called junior.guru.

Every two weeks we do one of the certification projects from the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

Each of the participants (including me) develops the project completely on her/his own. 

This activity is purely educational in nature with the advantage that participants encourage each other and give each other feedback after creating each project.
